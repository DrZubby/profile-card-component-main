### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I improved my layout skills especially with positioning and how to style multiple background images.	

### Continued development

I still need to improve on my ability to style multiple background images especially w.r.t making them responsive and look similar accross devices with different screen sizes.

I also need to get more familiar with the intricacies of the position attribute and also the behavior of absolute and relative positioning and how they behave in relation to each other and the document flow.
